UI/UX Design Prompt for Enhanced Aladin.AI Interface
Project Overview: Design an enhanced version of Aladin.AI, an AI-powered financial research assistant for crypto, stocks, and forex, with authentication, a freemium model, and payment integration. The interface, inspired by Perplexity AI, features a responsive sidebar navigation (Home, Discover, Charts, Library, Account, Settings), real-time data displays (CoinGecko, Alpha Vantage), interactive charts (Recharts), and a polished Settings page. The design must be responsive (mobile-first), default to dark mode at 12:42 AM PKT on October 12, 2025, and use enhanced gradients (#764ba2 to #667eea, #4ecdc4 to #45b7d1) with a gold accent (#d4af37) for premium features.
Target Users: Investors and traders (ages 25-50) seeking an intuitive, visually appealing financial tool.
Core Principles:

Aesthetic: Elegant, dark-themed (background #121212, text #ffffff), switchable to light mode (background #f5f5f5, text #333333) via Settings. Use Orbitron (headings) and Inter (body) fonts, subtle shadows, animated transitions (Framer Motion), and financial motifs (e.g., coin, chart icons from Heroicons).
UX Flow: Search-first interface with a central query input, sidebar navigation, and instant feedback (e.g., loading spinners). Settings offers theme toggle, notifications, language, and API keys.
Interactivity: Smooth page transitions (slide-in), hover glow on nav, animated toggle switch, and touch-friendly controls.
Accessibility & Performance: WCAG compliant (ARIA labels, high contrast), optimize for <2s load times.

Key Layouts & Enhancements:

Sidebar Navigation:

Layout: Fixed left (64px wide, collapsible on mobile), sticky top, animated slide-in.
Features: Hover glow, active state highlight, Account dropdown (Profile, Logout). Use Heroicons (e.g., User icon).
Mobile: Hamburger menu, swipe gesture to open, larger tap targets.
Interactions: Click nav items for smooth transitions, dropdown expands on hover/click.


Home Page (Search Interface):

Layout: Central search bar with mic/globe icons, grid of topic cards (e.g., Crypto Trends).
Enhancement: Animated card hover (scale + shadow), gradient backgrounds, loading spinner during AI response.
Interactions: Autocomplete with fuzzy matching, submit triggers slide-in results.


Discover, Charts, Library Pages:

Layout: Sidebar + central content (tables, charts, history).
Enhancement: Interactive tables (search/sort/filter with TanStack Table), Recharts charts with zoom/hover tooltips, animated data load.
Mobile: Stacked layout, pinch-to-zoom charts.


Account & Payment Plans Pages:

Layout: Dashboard (history, quota) and tiered plan cards (Free/Basic/Premium).
Enhancement: Gold accent for premium features, gradient buttons for upgrades, animated payment modal.
Interactions: Click plan → slide-in Stripe checkout, quota updates in real-time.


Settings Page:

Layout: Sidebar + central grid of card-based sections.
Features:

Theme: Animated toggle switch (slide effect) between Night (dark) and Day (light) modes, applied globally.
Notifications: Checkbox with instant save.
Language: Dropdown (English, Urdu).
API Keys: Input with gradient "Save" button, premium styling.


Enhancement: Card gradients, motion-animated toggle, error states with retry.
Interactions: Toggle switches theme instantly, save button validates API key.



Components & Patterns:

Cards: Rounded (15px), shadow, gradient backgrounds (e.g., from-aladin-primary to-aladin-accent).
Buttons: Gradient (#764ba2 to #667eea), white text, rounded (10px), hover scale.
Toggle: Custom switch with sliding indicator, animated via Framer Motion.
Animations: Fade-in on load, slide-in transitions, rotating spinner (coin motif).
Mobile: Collapsible sidebar, touch-optimized inputs.

Branding & Visuals:

Colors: Primary #764ba2, Accent #667eea, Secondary #4ecdc4, Gold #d4af37, Dark #121212, Light #f5f5f5.
Icons: SVG-based (Heroicons: coin, chart, user).
Typography: Orbitron (headings, 3xl), Inter (body, base).

Edge Cases: No data → animated skeleton; slow API → spinner; invalid input → friendly error with retry.
Deliverables: Update app/layout.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, app/settings/page.tsx in Next.js app router. Ensure integration with existing components (e.g., Recharts, Stripe).
